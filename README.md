# MC3DS-SmallMode
- A challenge mod for [Minecraft: "New" Nintendo 3DS Edition](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/New_Nintendo_3DS_Edition) (that makes you insanely small).
- Works for every region, and supports the [Latest Patch](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/New_Nintendo_3DS_Edition_1.9.19) of the Game!
- This mod is very different from the [SmallPlayer](https://github.com/Minecraft-3DS-Community/GamePatches/tree/main/smallPlayer) Patch in the [GamePatches](https://github.com/Minecraft-3DS-Community/GamePatches) Repo.

## Installing Mod:
- Download your regions' version of the Patch [Here](https://github.com/Cracko298/MC3DS-SmallMode/releases/latest).
- Extract the Downloaded `*.zip` file.
- Place the Patch in the Following Directory:
```
.\luma\titles\[mc3dsTID]\code.ips

The text [mc3dsTID] is your Regions TitleID.
USA  = 00040000001B8700
EUR  = 000400000017CA00
JPN  = 000400000017FD00

*The code.ips file does NOT go in the romfs folder.
**If the directory doesn't exist, create it with the above mention.
```

## Features:
- Small Player
- Faster Swimming
- Limited Reach
- Higher FOV
- No Fall Damage
- Higher Damage Rates

### Note:
- The player model itself (the skin) is only visual (the sizing stays default but doesn't affect mod itself).
- This is to enable compatibility with Multiplayer (for whatever psychopath actually plays it).

## Compiling Patch:
- I compiled my Patch using: [MC3DS IPS-Patch Tool](https://github.com/Minecraft-3DS-Community/IPS-Patch-Tool).
- However [LunarIPS](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/) or [FLIPS (Floating IPS)](https://github.com/Alcaro/Flips) work fine as well.

## Make Your Own!
- If you're interested in making your Own Patches for MC3DS, we have a Repo for this [Here](https://github.com/Minecraft-3DS-Community/GamePatches).
